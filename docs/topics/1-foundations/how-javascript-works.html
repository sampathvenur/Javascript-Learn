        <h2>The V8 Engine</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Javascript runs on a engine called V8</li>
            <li>This engine is found in Google chrome, node js etc.,</li>
            <li>This engine converts written code into machine code</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JIT (Just In Time) Compilation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>During the origin Javascript was interpreted</li>
            <li>But now using the engine it is JIT (Just In Time) Compilation</li>
            <li>That means, it starts fast as interpreter and optimize as compiler for repeatative task</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="topic-section">
        <h2>Single Threaded & Call Stack</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Javascript is single threaded - it can only do one thing at a time</li>
            <li>It uses call stack to track where it is in the program</li>
            <li>This call stack is LIFO - The last function called is first to finish</li>
        </ul>
