// Javascript runs on a engine called V8
// This engine is found in Google chrome, node js etc.,
// This engine converts written code into machine code

// During the origin Javascript was interpreted
// But now using the engine it is JIT (Just In Time) Compilation
// That means, it starts fast as interpreter and optimize as compiler for repeatative task

// Javascript is single threaded - it can only do one thing at a time
// It uses call stack to track where it is in the program
// This call stack is LIFO - The last function called is first to finish
